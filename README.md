# WiiMini-SDRST
WiiMini-SDRST is a custom made mod that adds back microSD card and reset button to Wii Mini console.

Wii Mini is a great little console but it was seriously crippled by Nintendo to reduce manufacturing costs. They removed SD card and reset button from the console which made it less desirable for homebrew use. My kit helps you add these features back! It's very easy to install thanks to a nice quick solder board.
